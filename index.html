        Web design and development are two sides of the same coin. Together, they create the websites we use every day, from simple blogs to complex web applications. This page explains the difference between the two and introduces the basic building blocks of the web: HTML.

    <!-- Section 1: Web Design -->
    <h2>What is Web Design?</h2>
    <p>
        Web design focuses on the visual and experiential aspects of a website. It involves deciding how a site looks, how users interact with it, and how the information is presented. A web designer uses tools to create layouts, choose color schemes, select typography, and ensure the site is user-friendly.

        Good web design ensures that a website is not only beautiful but also easy to navigate. It considers the user journey from the moment they land on the page to the moment they leave.

    <h2>What is Web Development?</h2>
    <p>
        Web development is the work that happens behind the scenes to make a website function. While design is about how it looks, development is about how it works. Developers write code that builds the site's structure, brings the designer's vision to life, and manages complex functionality.

        Web development is often divided into two categories: Front-end development (the client-side) and Back-end development (the server-side).

        Developers use powerful computers and specialized software (like VS Code) to write their code efficiently.

        The back-end involves databases and servers, ensuring that data is stored and retrieved correctly when a user interacts with the site.

    <!-- Section 3: HTML Basics -->
    <h2>Understanding HTML Tags</h2>
    <p>
        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages. It uses "tags" to define elements. There are two main types of tags you need to know:
    </p>

    <h3>1. Paired Tags</h3>
    <p>
        Paired tags consist of an opening tag and a closing tag. The content goes between them. The closing tag includes a forward slash (/) before the tag name.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> <code>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;h1&gt;Heading&lt;/h1&gt;</code>.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Empty Tags</h3>
    <p>
        Empty tags do not have a closing tag. They are used to insert content or create a break in the layout, but they do not wrap around text.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> (for images).
    </p>
